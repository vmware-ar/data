C8212,T1876,Bruno Teyton,IDC,General Reports Completed,Neutral," There has been growing interest in O-RAN in the CSP community in every region. In Europe, in October 2020, the O-RAN Alliance and the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) organized the first joint plugfest. BT, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefónica, and TIM hosted the event which focused on open RAN commercialization, supply chain diversification, and multivendor interoperability.

C8178,T1863,Andrew Lerner,Gartner,Verbal Comment,Positive,"Pere – seeing a motion towards everything encrypted – and VMware is able to add a layer in between that that sits at the IP over IP – the moment you go end-to-end, the value goes in this layer. The other element is this notion that when you go towards the cloud, the two elements that are changing the perception on this best of breed is the encryption and the fact that if I have to now run multiple SaaS properties, and I have to do hop by hop decryption across multiple locations, the latency that they introduce is insane. This is why customers are considering a holistic approach - what we are saying is that there has to be some sort of consolidation at some point to minimize the encryption and the latencies of going across all those services.

Couldn't agree more. This is absolutely huge. This is like what we tell clients when we describe what SASE is -  it's not a collection of service chained things across multiple pops, it's an integrated chain.",,3/3/2021,Strategy,SASE,,Pere Monclus,0,0,
C8177,T1863,Andrew Lerner,Gartner,Verbal Comment,Positive,"From my perspective,  multi cloud by itself means the intentional use of separate cloud services for the same workload, when I'm referring to multi cloud, I'm referring to intentional multi cloud it’s not necessarily in multiple clouds, but when you apply multi cloud and networking, it immediately becomes the latter. Most enterprises are in multiple clouds, either by hook or by crook, intentional or unintentional. Now, how do we apply networking for that? That's what I think of when I think of multi cloud. I think of consistent application of services to get to the cloud, consistent application of services inside the cloud, and across cloud. Any kind of networking function that exists from VPN in to load balancing within, to transport across is an opportunity where you could have an abstraction layer, and essentially provide a multi cloud feature. So, to me multi cloud, it's very hard to say multi cloud is a market because it's an abstraction layer that sits on top of many markets. To me multi cloud is qualifier for routing, or VPN, for load balancing, and there's different layers of value and adoption for each one of those. When I think of multi cloud, which you articulated, which is, ‘we have POPs, we're going to put network functions, network security functions, particularly, along with our SD-WAN in those pops and we're going to allow people to connect into multiple public cloud providers.

C7378,T1796,Peter Rutten,IDC,Verbal Comment,Neutral,"To understand cloud vs on prem, understand the steps in AI process:
1.	(most overlooked) Data preparation, cleansing. 70-80% of the work. Significant infrastructure is required. Plus, often a mix of structured and unstructured data. 
2.	Next step: Tends to be On premise functionality next. Lots of cost associated on experimenting on AI models in the cloud without immediate results. Data scientists like to experiment-reiterate-experiment etc. racking up cloud costs, so this kind of experimentation tends to be on prem.
3.	When the model is clear, get into the training stage. Training typically requires GPUs or some form of acceleration. All cloud providers have interesting advanced accelerated environments, all expensive. More Sophisticated businesses do an ROI calculation. Sometimes cloud, sometimes on prem. On prem gives you more control over the entire environment. Advantage that the server OEMs are actually providing very nice total infrastructure stacks. Comes virtualized, with containerization, Cuda, data science apps, now NVIDIA is certifying these server OEMs, it’s an attractive solution for many businesses. 
4.	Inferencing. Once trained, get to the stage of inferencing on it. How big is that model, how much inferencing? 100% AI and doing 100% inferencing on that application? Need CPUs or GPUs? Hardcoding to FPGAs, all these things play a role to decide better to run on prem, in the cloud, or at the edge (fastest growing deployment for AI inferencing.) Businesses compare rental cost in cloud with sophisticated inferencing infrastructure with lightweight GPUs vs. putting that together On prem themselves, where they need lots of help.",,2/8/2021,Market Dynamic,AI/ML,,Sheldon D'Paiva,0,0,AI-Ready Enterprise Platform Msg Test

So you have to have object storage with Arrikto, either on prem or public cloud object storage. They maintain this realm of data mobility/data protection independent of what you’re using for primary storage. I like this very much. I’m always a big fan of people using object storage. The least expensive storage either on prem or in the public cloud. So you can use it as a repository, and jump start your K8s wherever that might be. The product is called Rok. Very smart snapshots. Can recover a terabyte in :15 minutes, used to be 12 hours. Can use on prem or in the public cloud. You can go across AWS availability zones. It’s a Swiss army knife of data protection.

Sadly, that is the case within the Gartner community in general around VMware. I would say in general it’s the less informed analysts who aren’t aware of all the pioneering work that is being done with like Project Monterey, and making containers a first class citizen. They're just assuming containers will get rid of VMs. It’s an uninformed view, but if I hear it in the analyst community, there’s a risk it’s in the user community as well. But I think those using VMware day in and day out would not have that view. They’re a little bit more realistic about the investments that have been made over the course of a decade with VMware.

OpenShift is the winner right now: an abstraction above on prem and hyperscaler at the container level, and Financial Svcs are leading that. Around 40% of the contracts we review for OpenShift are Financial Services. Main reason they are doing it is they are (financially) regulated to not put all their eggs in one basket. Right now RedHat are winning that story, but they only have less than 5K customers using that style of container management platform across both. Half is Open Shift.

They continue to be very concerned about the operational challenges and the skill issues, particularly as we go into this next phase of whatever’s going on in the world. Lots of concerns around compliance, security, scalability, dealing with uncertainty. In terms of app modernization, I personally don’t get a lot of customers asking about the bare metal side of it. 

I feel that the majority of the market is still looking at containers on VMs. There certainly are, particularly folks who are building net new, that are asking the question about “avoiding the VMtax”.",,11/20/2020,Customer Related,Tanzu,,,0,0,

Less from a technical perspective. All they see is license cost savings. It’s really about, “Hey, I can take this thing out of my stack and save a ton of money.“  I think the messaging they are hearing has a lot to do with that. VMware is talking about containers and VMs, and everyone else is saying bare metal. Most competitors recommend or lean toward bare metal, as it’s in their interest not to have you in the stack. VMware talks about keeping VMs, putting you on the defensive. 'Why is this one person telling me to use VMs? It’s because they’re selling virtualization.' For competitors it’s easy to capitalize on that. But then you guys need to justify the need for virtualization, which is not so easy to do in a concise way. It’s been easy for the competition to weaponize that.

Security and Isolation is good, but I don’t think that really resonates with most customers. Difficult to do without getting super technical. Want to make it obvious to someone who is not deep into the technology to understand it. You do have a hard task to explain some of these things. For people for whom it’s not immediately intuitive, how can they grasp this if they’re a higher-up in the IT org, not an engineer? Get too technical and their eyes glaze over.

No one is pushing for it, but Containers are the next gen of virtualization, does this limit the need for a hypervisor?’ They’re mostly just musing. When I ask why this is coming up I don’t get a good answer. When you draw out the motivation, you hear 1 of 2 reasons:

As you become more cloud native, which doesn’t mean you’re running in the cloud, it means you have built system stacks that are modeled based on the cloud, that work well in the cloud, but with the right engineering can also work on premises. But the fundamental trend is that you push abstraction up the stack, you add layers of abstraction. As a result, control moves up the stack and away from the lower levels of the infrastructure. I think UP is short hand for cloud native architecture. I have slides and visualizations that show you stacking VMs on physical infrastructure, on metal, then containers on VMs, another layer on top of that which is serverless. As you add these layers, abstraction moves up the stack as does release control.

C5850,T1449,Andrew Lerner,Gartner,Verbal Comment,Positive,"This is extremely potentially disruptive to the traditional networking market. The reason I think that is VMware and specifically NSX, it is an overlay that sits on top of an existing physical infrastructure. The vendor that has the physical infrastructure has a high degree of influence, etc. With VMware partnering with NVIDIA, as well as Pensando and others, you have the potential to really scorch the earth here. You can say the network is now on the NIC, and the NIC is managed by whoever manages the servers. Then all the SW stuff you do in the network is in NSX.  You’d still need something to interconnect your servers together, but you could (depending on how you GTM with this), turn the traditional data center network fabric into a glorified patch panel. Again, that would require a pretty dramatic GTM change, and you’d have to attack multiple enterprise use cases. I don’t think that’s the intent. My sense is that this will be an approach and architecture that will be limited to some very specific use cases. Very, very high scale security things, some AI/ML processing. VMware will go in with this approach and say ‘Hey, you want ESXi with one of our SmartNIC / function accelerator card partners (Gartner) / DPU (NVIDIA). Think it would be a Small but important segment, important segment vs the mainstream enterprise and their several hundred data centers.

They run a full operating system instance. And so when you're offloading whatever you're offloading from the hypervisor layer to that device, you're effectively increasing the structure of the device from being a dumb passthrough to pretty much controlling the system from a central, you're demoting the CPU and you're increasing the structure of that device as a central unit.

-	Filled with buzzword
-	The remote worker is missing - there's no mention of any application from any user on any device from anywhere and, with COVID-19, that's such an important issue.
-	The concept of end to end zero trust is missing
-	Very focused on datacenter, branch and edge – no mention of campus – large parts of the network is missing
-	the idea of end to end authentication and end to end identities is spot on
-	no idea what a self-healing workflow is
-	application aware transactional services  - when I read that it doesn't at all speak to me about intra application communications
-	under the agility portion, this is very much traditional wide area data center, nothing about the remote worker
-	the user journeys and user application experience -  ‘too soft, too fuzzy, get concrete’
-	using smart NICs for hyper converged - why just hyper converged? Also be clear.
-	Answer the question – If I am a CIO, why do I care about the modern network?

-	the things you're saying makes sense to me - nothing confused me
-	Think the formatting and structure around it with the eight tenants doesn't work. Don't think it will resonate with the CIO, traditional network person, DevOps or SRE. The eight tenets don’t align with how clients talk to us about networking, regardless of their role.
-	Get it down to five or six - if there's eight pillars, and it doesn't perfectly align to what customers are saying then that alignment is probably matched to VMware products and so the complexity leads me to think skeptically.
-	Struggled to delineate between the first three tenets
-	Took away that scale means massive/ big – that’s not true as scale is also elasticity – scaling up/ down
-	Scaling down tenets -  my take on it would be, you could run any application anywhere with appropriate application experience that is self-driving and operates at Cloud scale across heterogeneous infrastructure.
-	- any app anywhere (1), application experience (2), networking (3), self driving cloud scale (4), heterogeneous infrastructure (5)
-	it's a more of a story with a theme and actually maps to the words that clients use when they talk to us about networking – more customer centric

-	referred to a conversation with Tom 2.5 years ago for the one line to describe this - goal is to deliver an Amazon like networking experience for VMware customers that's very different from ACI. It's not about the network, it's about the broader collection that the stack brings and network is just a piece and it should be pretty simple and easy with an API and self service catalog, etc. It's kind of native to what makes it easy to Amazon is what you're trying to deliver with your stack

C4523,T1351,,Gartner,Reports - In Progress,Neutral,"VMware scored a bit below average (in the product category) when compared to all the vendors in the MQ, and this had a big comparative impact on VMware’s execution score. VMware’s NSX and VRNI have solid capabilities. However, VMware does not offer switching hardware. Also, VMware does not offer a NOS. Most other vendors in the research offer both of these items and all other vendors in the research offer at least one of them. As a result, customers who are investing in buildouts or refresh must acquire, manage, and pay for switching hardware and NOS separately. This increases complexity and cost to customers. VMware has some certified hardware/NOS partners and has done some co-engineering with Dell (and some management of underlay with VRNI) but it falls well short of what many customers desire. In other words, VMware has put this problem on the shoulders of customers to address. There are 5 use-cases in the CC, and customers don’t consider VMware for 2 of them, including Enterprise refresh/buildout and Midmarket refresh/buildout. These 2 use-cases are the biggest drivers of spend in the market. Customers regularly comment that they would prefer a more integrated solution and/or to deal with fewer suppliers. VMware is also in the middle of a transition from NSX-V to NSX-T code-base, which customers complain about. 
VMware scored a bit below average when compared to all the vendors in the MQ, due to the pricing aspect (not sales execution).

Good mindshare, particularly with big Wall Street banks in the know-how of this ecosystem. Thinks this is due to: being early to market. Software-driven architecture, where it’s not just software, but they’ve also architected their storage software as a set of containers using microservices architecture. They talk  deeply about  being container native: snapshotting, replication, and encryption. They’ve thought about this in terms of a container volume level or a K8s pod level, that level of granularity. They've formed a decent partnership with RedHat. 

Wouldn’t call them highly successful….wouldn’t call anyone highly successful in this marketplace, but they are closest. They come up in inquiry more than any other vendor and are getting into the secondary storage space. Still a primary storage vendor, but seeing more opportunities for backup and DR. The last couple of briefings, they almost exclusively talked about developing those capabilities.

Large projects see a name they’ve never heard of, and are scared to invest with them. To get in and out with a massive amount of data is not easy. One thing I love about this approach is the idea that you have a high performance primary storage, then unstructured data designed for scale. They work together as a single tier. IF persistent storage going to grow for containers, it’s going to grow for the applications that need a lot of it, like AI/ML. 

Arrikto's approach is most interesting in the market. If you want large scale, they can give it, high performance, they can give it. That’s one of the more flexible environments. Otherwise you get stuck in a sort of a hyperconverged model: Here’s your storage, here’s your compute. What if my requirements change and I need more compute?  They’re really small and it’s going to be very difficult for them to grow, but I feel like their approach overall is the right approach for data services.",,5/11/2020,Competitive mentions/intel,Tanzu Application Catalog,Arrikto,Brad Bock,0,0,

Think this whole notion of multi cloud is going to ultimately be a gap filler. When we start to virtualize things, you buy your own networking stack, networking influence went to the vSwitch and even though it wasn't managed by the networking team, per se, you carved out a piece of networking and it never really got back.

Day to day deals gartner sees on AWS are $5-15m.  Only see a $5m Azure deal every couple of weeks. Consider size of Gartner’s deal desk, they see a lot of Azure. 
Azure is more for technology laggards.  Most laggards are reluctant to digitalize, slower in IT adoption, Their budgets don’t grow as quickly. Less good candidates to grow for Azure.  Most think they are going to shrink their budgets going to Azure.  AWS customers have large opportunity to drive infra consumption.

This visibility is even more valuable with attacks that penetrate defenses and encrypted communications obscuring much that can only be evident at endpoints.

Workspace ONE is the platform that combines the VMware Horizon capabilities with a unified endpoint management (UEM) capability from VMware AirWatch and VMware Identity Manager in a single solution.

Workspace ONE eliminates the need for administrators to change configurations by re-imaging endpoint devices as it supports remote configuration management based on what VMware calls dynamic smart groups.

Software distribution is another key aspect that consumes IT administrators time, but Workspace ONE uses scripting tools to automate these operations. 

Workspace ONE has its own set of secure business productivity applications (Hub, Boxer, Content, Web, Send, Verify, People, and PIV-D), as well as supporting a wide range of third-party applications. The VMware applications are considered more secure as they are containerized (i.e., enhanced encryption and policies) and designed to operate with Workspace ONE.

Workspace ONE uses different attributes to automate access requests to applications and data and these decisions are automated in real time so employees are not waiting for a decision. It is a benefit that the authentication context such as authentication method, user group, network location, and device state is used by Workspace ONE when making these access decisions.

Workspace ONE uses UEM from AirWatch and, through APIs, can connect and manage endpoint devices. These APIs ensure that even new or yet-to-be-released devices can be managed, providing the vendor adopts the standard use of APIs.",,6/21/2019,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),Cloud (VCPP),Citrix,,0,0,

We will take your new guidance into account and we will modify text to account for that. As it pertains to scoring, scoring will be adjusted. The second aspect of that is text related. When we were reviewing the text and going through internal peer reviews, we were trying to simplify the text and overdid it where we did apples to oranges. Your text – it is not lost on me that it is apples to oranges, the market for ethernet switching bit. We look at you guys from a revenue perspective – how the software works, is it perpetual, is it subscription. Number one, we will update the text to be much more applicable and a defensible metric. The third point is when you gave us the better granularity I sensed there was a concern on the VMware side about us excluding SNS when we calculate your growth. My comment to you back is dont assume that because we are asking for the granularity that we are excluding it.

You are evaluated against your peers not against yourself and how you have evolved. The weighting and criteria did change in execution this year, I havent run the numbers to see if that helps you or hurts you, but. I will tell you where you are below average: where you are losing ground is on product. You have heard that message from us before and have the same core systemic issues on product limitation that you know about and are working on. Specifically I am talking about hardware. From the perspective of a customer you dont solve the full challenge. It is not the only area on product but it is one. The other area is customer experience.

Their products are NOT at feature parity with VMware’s—as our report demonstrated—especially when it comes to hybrid cloud. Flow, in particular, lacks critical cloud-enabling functionality that NSX does easily. But, don’t disparage Nutanix’s offerings on that account. For the traditional HCI use cases, Flow is more than adequate. For example, if you have 1-3 smaller clusters running VDI, and a flat network, and just want microsegmentation between hosts/VMs. (In those circumstances, NSX might even be overkill.)

It’s happening in financial services and manufacturing industries.    • Enterprise are not implementing serverless yet.   • Today MSPs are partners but in the future, they may be competitors for the same dollars. Not just for technology but also for selling additional services and addressing the talent and skill set. • “Frictionless of Cloud”: Ecosystem is very important and connection to frictionless is going to be key for MultiCloud. • The cloud journey is complicated. Vendors are messaging to make it easy for LOBs. Provide a Service API that sits on to top. Provide opportunity for IT to curate choices. This introduces a whole world of ecosystems.  • Key tool capabilities to address hybrid and multicloud Management (vRealize) requirements are: o Governance, Provisioning, Cost, Security. o Monitoring can be plugged-in. • “Integrate to Consolidate is a good model for VMware.  It’s the least risky route to come together for CMP and is attractive to clients.”  •  “Build things to change, not build things to last.  Change is the constant.”- ServiceNow is doing this. • Cloud Consumption: In the Middle East, they like CapEx and love Private Cloud. They don’t want OpEx.  VMware Opportunity: “VMware should really push blockchain in the Middle East and in Germany.” • Enterprise Cloud Migration Path: Get in early of the cycle. Don’t start talking about CMP at the end of the discussion. The investment would be net new and harder. • IT sees security as a benefit is new.  Perception and meaning of security is changing.  It now looks at the full gamut of capabilities. • Manage SAP: Message of VMware can manage SAP in a multicloud environment is not getting out to customers. SAP has not drunk their own kool aid. Customers are asking how to they can take SAP into the cloud and manage it.  Be part of that messaging. Milind sees money to be made in this area. • Cloud Adoption Continuum: Milind thinks that CMP discussions can start at Cloud Readiness Assessment. Today Management (vRealize) is at the end of the buying cycle, bring it to the forefront from a practical point of view.  • Milind does not like the name/terminology “CloudHealth”. “Sounds like going to the doctor and who wants to go to the doctor.”","Regarding digital transformation, EMEA is looking at refreshing and getting out of legacy to modernize.

•	Difficult for infrastructure vendors to become a “security vendor”

o	Infrastructure vendors sell security products to make up for IT Ops deficiencies.  
•	Natural for customers to resist vendors as security solvers
•	Don’t join the security market – change the security market!
o	Control points – infrastructure solutions making security products work or making sure harder parts of attack surfaces are not being made vulnerable to attacks 
•	From an endpoint perspective:  Windows isn’t going away, but growth rate is slowing.  
o	Need for spend on endpoint detection is going down 
o	100% have endpoint protection, 33% add another layer administered by end-user teams  for added security.

o	Endgame – threat code for the government.  They still have investment to take that knowledge and go after detection and response.  Move slowly, happy customers, making progress
•	From a partner perspective – focus on interoperability vs # of partners.  
•	Future trends: 
o	% of sensitive transactions on Windows is getting smaller.  Tablet, iOS, Android growing.

Date: February 11, 2019
Highlights:
•	Traditional Provisioning and Automation will become less important across a number of different vectors from CMP and functionality standpoint.  Folks will be using what is native and hyperscale providers are already doing it.  
o	The days of traditional Provisioning are gone. Provisioning still comes into play in hybrid.  Customers still want for an on-prem and public cloud scenario.  Developers need to be able to span.  Archiving and migrations might also have a vertical play. 
o	The world is moving away from Provisioning as a one-time action (VMware agrees).  Need on an ongoing basis.  
o	Many vendors have come from provisioning in MQ last year.  This may change next year. 
•	Dennis sees the future of domain and how to govern of all the stuff (workload optimization, inventory, security, tagging and cost) as increasingly important for enterprises.  He is starting to see more one-off vendors (includes CloudHealth) adding more capability.
o	There is a set horizontal items around governance and very applicable.  Lighter but effective footprint.  Using services to give speed but also environmental hygiene.
o	Helps I&O folks stay relevant.  Enterprises need guardrails. 
•	Automation is still key but is changing/evolving.
•	Monitoring will be less important depending on the use case.  It makes sense for certain aspects to be native.  Ex. Google, Microsoft.  Application Performance Monitoring will be there and trying to go down to infrastructure layer.  Hyperscale vendors might also go up the stack over time (becomes sticky). 
o	 Splitting apps across environments (he calls this hybrid) will have a need for monitoring and glue across.  Multi-cloud (most of what he sees from customers) not seeing a spitting of apps so less need. 
o	Traditional Network Monitoring- Dennis wonders how effective it will be as it’s difficult.

There is no vendor doing it all. We are very early.  Some are doing random bits and leveraging basic technology.  Claiming AIOps through anomaly detection.  We are super early in the Hype Cycle.  Vendors take bits of data and apply AI/ML in an actionable way.  The domain centric tools are also in the AIOps bandwagon. There are two groups of vendors:          -Group A: Take on event correlation.  Seen early success for applying ML algorithms.             -Group B: Log first and are applying light correlation to that data.  Ie. Splunk.   • Sanjit’s Number one issue in Inquiry from customers is to Help with Tool Sprawl.  They are trying to figure out if AIOps going to solve the single pane of glass issue? • Sanjit currently sees Wavefront with some level of event correlation and time series metric analysis. This puts WF in Infrastructure focus with a touch of event.  Distributed Tracing is moving more towards APM but policy lacks. He considers anomaly detection to be table stakes in AIOps. • With regard to AIOps vs. Observability, Sanjit doesn’t hear Observability term.  He sees them meaning different things.  Observability is passive. AIOps is taking data from systems and making it actionable.  APM has about 5-10% workloads in ITOps space are implemented with full monitoring.  Comes down to cost. Distributed Tracing is a model that might work better economically. Datadog comes up. Data Acquisition is a good thing and Wavefront does it well.  Good opportunity for Wavefront.",Customers have tool sprawl and are trying to figure out if AIOps going to solve the single pane of glass issue.

•	This year cloud spend was 8% of budgets vs. 5% last year.  Shows growth in digital transformation. App Dev grew by 8-10% and data center shrunk from 25% to 18%.
•	VMware opportunity is to build a story at some levels of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud.  vRealize suits the data center out strategy. New acquisition of CloudHealth tends to be cloud across and great visibility across multiple clouds.  It has multiple intersections on trends like provisioning and automation.
•	Cloud Management (vRealize) space had too many discrete players and many have been gobbled up.  Old style (RedHat and VMW) and new platforms.  CloudHealth ticks the right boxes in the new capabilities. Suggests intersection of two areas and bringing them together is the opportunity for the next 2 years.

•-Recognize Cloud (VCPP) adoption doesn’t have great forecasting skills and is fragmented.  There are too many chefs in the kitchen.  LOBs are sometimes driving their own decisions and not involving IT.  How much are Cloud (VCPP) resources costing and data cleanliness are key issues.  Security compliance deals with their own set of issues for governance but might care about cost as well.  Governance and integration has many intersections.  Sometimes groups are working in parallel but not always.  You can map back from a maturity standpoint but it becomes a question of ownership and impact on the future.  Reality is there is a lot of immaturity and plenty of organizations would be happy to have a clean and consistent data set that is agreed upon across the board.
•-As customers adopt agile and DevOps, they are experimenting and this does impact cost and budget allocation.  Agile gives an opportunity to make the conversation happen.  There is a transformation and companies are starting to look at cost transparency and budget allocation.  DevSecOps is hard to pull off.  It’s increasingly important and driving the need for transparency.
