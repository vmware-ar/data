Good mindshare, particularly with big Wall Street banks in the know-how of this ecosystem. Thinks this is due to: being early to market. Software-driven architecture, where it’s not just software, but they’ve also architected their storage software as a set of containers using microservices architecture. They talk  deeply about  being container native: snapshotting, replication, and encryption. They’ve thought about this in terms of a container volume level or a K8s pod level, that level of granularity. They've formed a decent partnership with RedHat. 

Wouldn’t call them highly successful….wouldn’t call anyone highly successful in this marketplace, but they are closest. They come up in inquiry more than any other vendor and are getting into the secondary storage space. Still a primary storage vendor, but seeing more opportunities for backup and DR. The last couple of briefings, they almost exclusively talked about developing those capabilities.

Portworx is very expensive. A lot of the data science use cases tend to be open source-oriented rather than commercial retooling-oriented for early adopters.

Now we’ve observed the life of a container can be days and maybe a week, it’s still alive. You need to store some data, even if it’s not truly persistent data.

It’s really good because you also use it as a transient layer. You have a snapshot in object storage, then you can move it to the public cloud. You can utilize the same APIs on prem or at the public cloud. Low entry is the beauty of their solution. You already have a node that you deployed your pod on. Large projects see a name they’ve never heard of, and are scared to invest with them. To get in and out with a massive amount of data is not easy. One thing I love about this approach is the idea that you have a high performance primary storage, then unstructured data designed for scale. They work together as a single tier. IF persistent storage going to grow for containers, it’s going to grow for the applications that need a lot of it, like AI/ML. 

Arrikto's approach is most interesting in the market. If you want large scale, they can give it, high performance, they can give it. That’s one of the more flexible environments. Otherwise you get stuck in a sort of a hyperconverged model: Here’s your storage, here’s your compute. What if my requirements change and I need more compute?

They may be made by the data science team, or an ML engineer who probably comes from a devops background or a software engineering devops background, but is also tasked with running ML. They aren’t aware of VMware’s value proposition in this space, or don’t see VMware as strategic vendor.

Inquiry questions I'm getting vary from understanding pricing and discounting to a more common inquiry of choosing to go more native to AWS or VMC on AWS. I get occasional questions about Azure, but that's really really low at this point. I'm getting comments from more larger clients who are determining that VMC on AWS is more expensive. It's seen as an expensive alternative. Nothing much on hybrid. Occasionally, I get customers who are seeing VMC as a stepping stone to full migration. That's larger organizations with forcing function of closing a data center. I get impression that those migrations never go as fast as they thought.

Those who want to buy the full package(a kubernetes distro) but concerned about lockin. Most will end up doing this, not wanting to deal with the sprawl themselves. Everyone has this pipedream of complete portability which of course doesn’t exist. I tell our clients that Lock-in is value. Differentiated value is tons of lock in. That's true the more management gets simplified and the more it’s tied into another existing proprietary capability, like the VMware stack. I generally tell clients if you’ll be locked in, extract every ounce of value from that lock in. That tends to encourage buying more from your current vendors (like VMware).",#N/A,2020-02-20,Customer Related,#N/A,vSphere 7 with K8s,VCF Services,#N/A,#N/A,#N/A,Matt Morgan,Pete Chargin/Jared Rosoff,#N/A,,

For most employees, this means bringing their laptops home and leveraging multifactor authentication (MFA) to access their applications.

People generally substitute those two words. So what you have in this catalogue is a developers catalogue to build workloads into applications. An app is what a consumer buys. A workload is what is provisioned to fulfill the application. Beginning to look at not only cataloguing for developers, but cataloguing for consumption and need. Said its great that VMware are going to drive the developer community in this way.

Further, many enterprises are considering the possibility of consolidating their on-premises data center infrastructure in favor of colocation, hosting, managed services and cloud. 
These drivers are in addition to improved access to increased levels of agility and innovation from leading public cloud providers.

•	EMM Market share 2018 was a two horse race between MSFT and VMware
•	With MSFT, adoption is around Azure and then they will move to InTune in the future for the whole device management piece
•	Customers have an increasing desire to deal with one supplier
•	IDC is finding that jobs havent been shifted yet and in most cases staff have been reimplemented within the business
•	Mobile worker increase of 2.6% in the next five years increasing to 127m workers
o	The discussion around Mobile Worker was really good, and is an opportunity for us to help IDC build out their definition moving forward to get beyond the focus on Office 365 and have a more holistic definition. 
•	Security still seems reactive even though it is cited as a top need

,,Roy Illsley,Ovum,Other,,Positive,"Ovum DaaS Market Landscape Report Highlights
Workspace ONE is the platform that combines the VMware Horizon capabilities with a unified endpoint management (UEM) capability from VMware AirWatch and VMware Identity Manager in a single solution.

Workspace ONE eliminates the need for administrators to change configurations by re-imaging endpoint devices as it supports remote configuration management based on what VMware calls dynamic smart groups.

Software distribution is another key aspect that consumes IT administrators time, but Workspace ONE uses scripting tools to automate these operations. 

Workspace ONE has its own set of secure business productivity applications (Hub, Boxer, Content, Web, Send, Verify, People, and PIV-D), as well as supporting a wide range of third-party applications. The VMware applications are considered more secure as they are containerized (i.e., enhanced encryption and policies) and designed to operate with Workspace ONE.

Workspace ONE uses different attributes to automate access requests to applications and data and these decisions are automated in real time so employees are not waiting for a decision. It is a benefit that the authentication context such as authentication method, user group, network location, and device state is used by Workspace ONE when making these access decisions.

Workspace ONE uses UEM from AirWatch and, through APIs, can connect and manage endpoint devices. These APIs ensure that even new or yet-to-be-released devices can be managed, providing the vendor adopts the standard use of APIs.

,,Andrew Lerner,Gartner,Gartner Magic Quadrant,,Advice,"Re: DCN MQ Fact Review guidance provided by VMware: First thing that pertains to factual accuracy is the guidance around product license growth.  subsequent discussions, you guys have given us better guidance and told us we were low. We will take your new guidance into account and we will modify text to account for that. As it pertains to scoring, scoring will be adjusted. The second aspect of that is text related. When we were reviewing the text and going through internal peer reviews, we were trying to simplify the text and overdid it where we did apples to oranges. Your text – it is not lost on me that it is apples to oranges, the market for ethernet switching bit. We look at you guys from a revenue perspective – how the software works, is it perpetual, is it subscription. Number one, we will update the text to be much more applicable and a defensible metric. The third point is when you gave us the better granularity I sensed there was a concern on the VMware side about us excluding SNS when we calculate your growth. My comment to you back is dont assume that because we are asking for the granularity that we are excluding it.

,,Andrew Lerner,Gartner,Gartner Magic Quadrant,,Negative,"On these fact review calls – what if the vendor has a concern about dot position. We can give you some directional guidance. The first thing I will say is we look at the market year over year – we dont bring scores forward. You are evaluated against your peers not against yourself and how you have evolved. The weighting and criteria did change in execution this year, I havent run the numbers to see if that helps you or hurts you, but. I will tell you where you are below average: where you are losing ground is on product. You have heard that message from us before and have the same core systemic issues on product limitation that you know about and are working on. Specifically I am talking about hardware. From the perspective of a customer you dont solve the full challenge. It is not the only area on product but it is one. The other area is customer experience. Customer experience is a couple of data points – the biggest portion of the fact basis is our inquiry but it is also driven by customer reference surveys and Peer Insights.

It’s happening in financial services and manufacturing industries.    • Enterprise are not implementing serverless yet.   • Today MSPs are partners but in the future, they may be competitors for the same dollars. Not just for technology but also for selling additional services and addressing the talent and skill set. • “Frictionless of Cloud”: Ecosystem is very important and connection to frictionless is going to be key for MultiCloud. • The cloud journey is complicated. Vendors are messaging to make it easy for LOBs. Provide a Service API that sits on to top. Provide opportunity for IT to curate choices. This introduces a whole world of ecosystems.  • Key tool capabilities to address hybrid and multicloud Management (vRealize) requirements are: o Governance, Provisioning, Cost, Security. o Monitoring can be plugged-in. • “Integrate to Consolidate is a good model for VMware.  It’s the least risky route to come together for CMP and is attractive to clients.”  •  “Build things to change, not build things to last.  Change is the constant.”- ServiceNow is doing this. • Cloud Consumption: In the Middle East, they like CapEx and love Private Cloud. They don’t want OpEx.  VMware Opportunity: “VMware should really push blockchain in the Middle East and in Germany.” • Enterprise Cloud Migration Path: Get in early of the cycle. Don’t start talking about CMP at the end of the discussion. The investment would be net new and harder. • IT sees security as a benefit is new.  Perception and meaning of security is changing.  It now looks at the full gamut of capabilities. • Manage SAP: Message of VMware can manage SAP in a multicloud environment is not getting out to customers. SAP has not drunk their own kool aid. Customers are asking how to they can take SAP into the cloud and manage it.  Be part of that messaging. Milind sees money to be made in this area. • Cloud Adoption Continuum: Milind thinks that CMP discussions can start at Cloud Readiness Assessment.

•	Don’t join the security market – change the security market!
o	Control points – infrastructure solutions making security products work or making sure harder parts of attack surfaces are not being made vulnerable to attacks 
•	From an endpoint perspective:  Windows isn’t going away, but growth rate is slowing.  
o	Need for spend on endpoint detection is going down 
o	100% have endpoint protection, 33% add another layer administered by end-user teams  for added security. 
o	Admins doing want to add “one more box” to what already have
•	Windows admins can deep windows secure without adding 3rd party SW.  Business side will drive to do things that reduce vulnerabilities.  
•	When system admins own the keys to protect the endpoints and administer the endpoints, bad things happen.  No one is minding the ship.  
•	Players
o	Cylance – lots of press coverage, valuation was high, good threat data
o	Crowdstrike – around for a long time, slow growing, lifestyle company looking for high growth trajections 
	Happy customers, growing customer base and growing within customer base 
	Born in the cloud is a benefit for them 
o	carbon black – in sue, expanded use within companies, if added features, companies would use them more
	SANS community (threat hunters/incident response) likes them 
o	SentinelOne – Lots of false positives.  Not hearing much about them recently
o	Endgame – threat code for the government.  They still have investment to take that knowledge and go after detection and response.  Move slowly, happy customers, making progress
•	From a partner perspective – focus on interoperability vs # of partners.  
•	Future trends: 
o	% of sensitive transactions on Windows is getting smaller.  Tablet, iOS, Android growing.  
o	End user side is in a constrained environment (apple store/android store) which make it necessary to buy extra security

Topic: Inquiry CMP/Automation
Date: February 11, 2019
Highlights:
•	Traditional Provisioning and Automation will become less important across a number of different vectors from CMP and functionality standpoint.  Folks will be using what is native and hyperscale providers are already doing it.  
o	The days of traditional Provisioning are gone. Provisioning still comes into play in hybrid.  Customers still want for an on-prem and public cloud scenario.  Developers need to be able to span.  Archiving and migrations might also have a vertical play. 
o	The world is moving away from Provisioning as a one-time action (VMware agrees).  Need on an ongoing basis.  
o	Many vendors have come from provisioning in MQ last year.  This may change next year. 
•	Dennis sees the future of domain and how to govern of all the stuff (workload optimization, inventory, security, tagging and cost) as increasingly important for enterprises.  He is starting to see more one-off vendors (includes CloudHealth) adding more capability.
o	There is a set horizontal items around governance and very applicable.  Lighter but effective footprint.  Using services to give speed but also environmental hygiene.
o	Helps I&O folks stay relevant.  Enterprises need guardrails. 
•	Automation is still key but is changing/evolving.
•	Monitoring will be less important depending on the use case.  It makes sense for certain aspects to be native.  Ex. Google, Microsoft.  Application Performance Monitoring will be there and trying to go down to infrastructure layer.  Hyperscale vendors might also go up the stack over time (becomes sticky). 
o	 Splitting apps across environments (he calls this hybrid) will have a need for monitoring and glue across.  Multi-cloud (most of what he sees from customers) not seeing a spitting of apps so less need. 
o	Traditional Network Monitoring- Dennis wonders how effective it will be as it’s difficult.

There is no vendor doing it all. We are very early.  Some are doing random bits and leveraging basic technology.  Claiming AIOps through anomaly detection.  We are super early in the Hype Cycle.  Vendors take bits of data and apply AI/ML in an actionable way.  The domain centric tools are also in the AIOps bandwagon. There are two groups of vendors:          -Group A: Take on event correlation.  Seen early success for applying ML algorithms.             -Group B: Log first and are applying light correlation to that data.  Ie. Splunk.   • Sanjit’s Number one issue in Inquiry from customers is to Help with Tool Sprawl.  They are trying to figure out if AIOps going to solve the single pane of glass issue? • Sanjit currently sees Wavefront with some level of event correlation and time series metric analysis. This puts WF in Infrastructure focus with a touch of event.  Distributed Tracing is moving more towards APM but policy lacks. He considers anomaly detection to be table stakes in AIOps. • With regard to AIOps vs. Observability, Sanjit doesn’t hear Observability term.  He sees them meaning different things.  Observability is passive. AIOps is taking data from systems and making it actionable.  APM has about 5-10% workloads in ITOps space are implemented with full monitoring.  Comes down to cost. Distributed Tracing is a model that might work better economically. Datadog comes up. Data Acquisition is a good thing and Wavefront does it well.  Good opportunity for Wavefront.",Customers have tool sprawl and are trying to figure out if AIOps going to solve the single pane of glass issue.

•	Hybrid and container adoption is small.  More written about kubernetes than customers using it.
•	There is no consistent definition in Gartner for multi-cloud.  Michael sees as an application that has duplicate capabilities in multiple clouds. Vast majority of enterprises will have multi-cloud. 
•	This year cloud spend was 8% of budgets vs. 5% last year.  Shows growth in digital transformation. App Dev grew by 8-10% and data center shrunk from 25% to 18%.
•	VMware opportunity is to build a story at some levels of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud.  vRealize suits the data center out strategy. New acquisition of CloudHealth tends to be cloud across and great visibility across multiple clouds.  It has multiple intersections on trends like provisioning and automation.
•	Cloud Management (vRealize) space had too many discrete players and many have been gobbled up.  Old style (RedHat and VMW) and new platforms.  CloudHealth ticks the right boxes in the new capabilities. Suggests intersection of two areas and bringing them together is the opportunity for the next 2 years.

Stephen:
•-Recognize Cloud (VCPP) adoption doesn’t have great forecasting skills and is fragmented.  There are too many chefs in the kitchen.  LOBs are sometimes driving their own decisions and not involving IT.  How much are Cloud (VCPP) resources costing and data cleanliness are key issues.  Security compliance deals with their own set of issues for governance but might care about cost as well.  Governance and integration has many intersections.  Sometimes groups are working in parallel but not always.  You can map back from a maturity standpoint but it becomes a question of ownership and impact on the future.  Reality is there is a lot of immaturity and plenty of organizations would be happy to have a clean and consistent data set that is agreed upon across the board.
•-As customers adopt agile and DevOps, they are experimenting and this does impact cost and budget allocation.  Agile gives an opportunity to make the conversation happen.  There is a transformation and companies are starting to look at cost transparency and budget allocation.  DevSecOps is hard to pull off.  It’s increasingly important and driving the need for transparency.

VMware is such a strong player in larger accounts.  As you build out the platform to reach out to new audiences (office of CTO, finance, etc.), make sure you have the on-ramps to talk about value from a cost standpoint, process optimization, and lower security risk.  Communicate GTM footprint to different buyers and meet with them for time to market and cost optimization.  There is a lot of noise in the market.  Be clear on how all the pieces fit together and drive value to different buyers regardless of where they reside.

Mainstream adopters aren't going native. I'd like to see more inquiries in 2019 ... Cloud Health - interesting acquisition. How will VMC on AWS leverage that data? How many customers with VMC?

Gartner predicted it three years ago.  Joe doesn't believe there ever will be a happy relationship between Cisco and VMware.  Cisco's view is that it is better to have ACI under NSX so that in 3 years when licenses renew they can tell customers to throw out NSX because they already have ACI licenses. Gartner doesn't see a real cisco strategy yet.  Still silo’d orgs within Cisco.  ACI folks get bonused on revenue.  Cisco believes the pie is fixed and they want more of the revenue.  Joe stated that he was speaking with a customer in Australia and his compnay won't let him buy ACI because of product complexity, instability, buggyness.","Joe encouraged VMware to do more with Dell from a HW perspective.
